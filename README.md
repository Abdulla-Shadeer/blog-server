This is the server side program of the mern stack based blogging system I've created 
(available here: https://github.com/Abdulla-Shadeer/blog-demo).

Please add the below mentioned environment variables to the .env 
file in order to start the express server.

1.Â  MONGO = <url of your mongodb database>
2. JWTADMIN = <Base64 32 bit string as a secret key for generating admin access token>
3. JWTDEMO = <Another Base64 32 bit string for demo users >

In Linux, use the following command to generate a base64 string: 
"openssl rand -base64 32"
